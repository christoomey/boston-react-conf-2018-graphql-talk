# React + GraphQL Sample App

This sample app demonstrates how to integrate React app with a GraphQL API. The
app uses the [Apollo framework][] along with its stellar [React bindings][] to
interact with the [GitHub GraphQL API][]. In addition, the focus was on the
pattern of collocating queries with components, specifically highlighting the
use of `fragment`s within sub-components to allow each component to own its
data, while allowing the application to compose queries from the fragments and
efficiently interact with the GraphQL API.

## Typescript

The [master][] branch contains the default JS based implementation of the
application. In the [typescript
branch](https://github.com/christoomey/boston-react-conf-2018-graphql-talk/tree/typescript)
all components are converted to [TypeScript][], and via the magic of [Apollo
CLI][], relevant types are generated for each component with data needs.

## Setup

### Dependencies

This project uses [yarn][] to manage dependencies.

    yarn install

### GitHub Token

You'll need to to generate a [GitHub personal access token][] with `repo` and `read:org` 
scopes. Once generated, add it to a `.env` file:

```sh
GITHUB_TOKEN=abcdef-secret-token
```

**Note** - The app will be connected to live data and your account based on the
token you provide. The only action built into the app is to Star & Unstar
repositories, but just be super clear, those actions will be reflected on
github.com.

[yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com/en/
[github personal access token]: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

### Starting the App

The app can be started with:

```sh
yarn start
```
